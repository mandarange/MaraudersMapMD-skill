Apply it as-is. `${source}` stands for the user-provided Markdown.\n\nYou are an expert technical editor. Rewrite the Markdown to maximize readability and scan-ability while preserving meaning and intent.\n\nCore requirements:\n- Keep the final language the same as the original (do not translate). If mixed, use the dominant language.\n- Never translate user-authored prose, headings, labels, or explanatory sentences into another language.\n- If the source is Korean, output must remain Korean except for literals that are already in English (for example code, API names, CLI flags, product names, or quoted identifiers).\n- Preserve all facts, constraints, and technical details. Do not add new information.\n- Keep Markdown semantics correct (headings, lists, tables, code fences, links).\n- Use the project's AI hint block format where it helps: \"> [AI RULE]\", \"> [AI DECISION]\", \"> [AI TODO]\", \"> [AI CONTEXT]\".\n- Prefer short paragraphs, clear headings, and consistent numbering.\n- Use tables for settings, options, or structured comparisons when helpful.\n- Keep code blocks and inline code exactly as-is.\n- Convert ASCII art visuals to the appropriate visual format (see \"ASCII visual content classification\" below):\n  - **Data tables** drawn with ASCII borders → proper Markdown pipe tables.\n  - **Diagrams** (flowcharts, ER, architecture) → HTML rendering → screenshot PNG image.\n  - **Charts** (bar charts, histograms, sparklines) → Markdown tables (simple) or HTML rendering → screenshot PNG image (complex).\n- Remove fluff and redundancy; keep only what's necessary.\n- Output ONLY the final Markdown. No commentary.\n\nFormatting guidance:\n- Ensure headings follow a clean hierarchy.\n- Convert dense prose into bullet lists where it improves readability.\n- Keep a concise top summary if the document is long.\n\nSOURCE MARKDOWN (do not omit any content):\n<<<BEGIN MARKDOWN\n${source}\nEND MARKDOWN>>>\n",

Each phase uses a MaraudersMapMD artifact as its primary reference.\n\n### Original file protection rule\n\n- The original source file must remain completely untouched. Never generate shards, indexes, or any MaraudersMapMD artifacts from the original.\n- All sharding, indexing, and artifact generation targets the rewritten version file (`<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md`) exclusively.\n- The original exists solely as a reference for fact-checking; it must never be modified, copied into artifact directories, or have artifacts derived from it.\n\nArtifact paths (generated from the rewritten file only):\n- SQLite Index (cross-doc): `docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db`\n- Diagram Images: `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/*.png`\n- Rewritten Markdown (single active version): `<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md`\n\n> [AI RULE] `<docId>` is derived from the normalized base name, not the versioned filename (e.g. `guide.rewritten_v1.md` and `guide.rewritten_v2.md` both use docId `guide`). Use one stable `<docId>` per logical document. Never create version-suffixed docIds like `guide_v2`.\n\n### Language lock rule (highest priority)\n\n- The rewritten output must preserve the source language exactly; translation is prohibited unless the user explicitly asks for translation.\n- If source content is Korean, keep Korean narrative text, headings, and list items in Korean.\n- Keep existing English technical literals as-is (commands, code, identifiers, API names, file paths, env vars).\n- If mixed-language content exists, preserve each segment's original language unless the user requests normalization.\n- If a generated section accidentally changes language, treat it as a blocking error and rewrite that section before finalizing.\n\n> [AI RULE] Language drift (for example Korean source rewritten in English) is a hard failure. Fix before completion.\n\n### SQLite-first access rule (always-on)\n\n- For fast lookup and reading, use the SQLite index (`docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db`) as the primary retrieval source.\n- Section pack files (`sections/*.md`, `index.json`, `ai-map.md`, `shards.json`) are optional implementation artifacts, not the primary retrieval path.\n- On cache miss or low-confidence retrieval from SQLite, fall back to the rewritten Markdown file first, then the original source file only when needed for fact verification.\n- If artifacts derived from the original file are found, delete them immediately.\n\n### Retrieval order for accuracy\n\nWhen answering or extracting facts, use this order to minimize drift:\n1. SQLite index (`docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db`) via keyword/BM25/regex.\n2. Rewritten full document (`<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md`) for local context recovery.\n3. Original source document only when cache miss persists or rewritten content is incomplete.\n\n### Retrieval routing\n\nChoose the fastest retrieval path based on the query scope:\n\n| Query Scope | Route | Tool |\n|---|---|---|\n| Single section by keyword | **SQLite keyword** | `python shards_search.py --db docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db --keyword \"<kw>\" --doc \"<docId>\"` |\n| Relevance-ranked results | **SQLite FTS5** | `python shards_search.py --db docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db --query \"<text>\" --doc \"<docId>\" --top 5` |\n| Cross-doc relevance search | **SQLite FTS5** | `python shards_search.py --db docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db --query \"<text>\" --top 5` |\n| Regex pattern match | **SQLite regex** | `python shards_search.py --db docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db --regex \"<pattern>\" --doc \"<docId>\"` |\n| Cache miss recovery | **Fallback 1** | Open `<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md` directly |\n| Persistent miss / verification | **Fallback 2** | Open original source file directly |\n\n> [AI RULE] Always query SQLite first. Only fall back when SQLite returns no relevant hits or confidence is insufficient for a correct answer.\n\n### Doc-type awareness\n\nDifferent document types benefit from different retrieval strategies:\n\n| Doc Type | Signal | Strategy |\n|---|---|---|\n| API Reference | Many short sections, code-heavy | Keyword search → exact section |\n| Tutorial/Guide | Sequential sections, prose-heavy | BM25 → top 3, read in order |\n| Configuration | Tables, key-value pairs | Keyword → single section |\n| Architecture | Diagrams, cross-references | Cross-doc search → multiple sections |\n| Mixed | No dominant pattern | BM25 → top 5, scan titles first |\n\n> [AI CONTEXT] Doc-type is inferred from SQLite hit distribution and rewritten content structure. No explicit tagging required.\n\n### Parallel execution rule\n\nWhen working with multiple documents or many sections, maximize throughput by running independent operations in parallel.\n\nParallelizable operations (no ordering dependency):\n\n| Operation | Parallel Unit | Constraint |\n|---|---|---|\n| Multi-document rewrite | Each document is independent | Different `<docId>` → safe to parallelize |\n| SQLite lookup for multiple docs | One query per doc | Safe in parallel; keep per-doc `--doc` filter |\n| Per-doc DB ingest | One ingest per doc | Use `python shards_db.py --ingest docs/MaraudersMap/<docId> --map-root docs/MaraudersMap` |\n| Verification (Phase 5 checks) | Per-document | Each document's checklist is independent |\n\nMust remain sequential (ordering dependency exists):\n\n| Operation | Reason |\n|---|---|\n| Phase 1 → 2 → 3 within a single document | Each phase depends on the previous |\n| Rewrite completion → DB ingest | DB must ingest the finalized rewritten content |\n| DB ingest → DB-first retrieval | Retrieval must read the latest content from SQLite |\n\nExecution strategy by scale:\n\n| Scale | Strategy |\n|---|---|\n| 1 document, ≤5 sections | Sequential is fine |\n| 1 document, >5 sections | Rewrite with local ordering; run SQLite verification queries in parallel |\n| 2–5 documents | Parallel-rewrite all documents simultaneously |\n| >5 documents | Batch: parallel-rewrite up to 5 at a time, then run per-doc `shards_db.py --ingest` in batches |\n\n> [AI RULE] When the AI agent supports parallel tool calls or background tasks, it MUST use them for independent operations listed above. Sequential processing of independent documents is a performance bug.\n\n### Accuracy guardrails\n\n- Do not infer facts that are not present in SQLite hits, rewritten Markdown, or the original source.\n- If SQLite hits disagree with rewritten Markdown, treat rewritten Markdown as source of truth and re-ingest the document.\n- If rewritten Markdown is ambiguous or incomplete, validate against the original source before answering.\n\n### SQLite cache-aside rule (Python-first)\n\n- Use SQLite (`docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db`) as the default retrieval cache.\n- On every rewritten update, re-ingest the doc into SQLite before answering queries.\n- Query SQLite first. On miss/low-confidence, fall back to rewritten Markdown; if still unresolved, fall back to original source.\n- Use `python shards_db.py --init --map-root docs/MaraudersMap` once per project.\n- Use `python shards_db.py --ingest docs/MaraudersMap/<docId> --map-root docs/MaraudersMap` after each rewrite update.\n- Use `python shards_search.py --db docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db --doc \"<docId>\" --query \"<text>\" --top 5` for per-doc relevance retrieval.\n- Use `python shards_search.py --db docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db --query \"<text>\" --top 5` for cross-doc retrieval.\n- Optional: `sections/*.md`, `index.json`, `ai-map.md`, and `shards.json` may exist as debug artifacts, but retrieval must not depend on them.\n\n### ASCII visual content classification\n\nBefore converting any ASCII art, classify it into one of three categories. The category determines the target format.\n\nDecision tree:\n\n1. **Does the ASCII block contain rows of data with column alignment?** (column headers, separator rows like `+---+---+` or `├───┼───┤`, and cells holding data values such as names, numbers, or settings)\n   → **Category: Data Table** → convert to Markdown pipe table (see \"ASCII-to-Markdown-table conversion rule\").\n\n2. **Does the ASCII block represent a quantitative visualization?** (bar lengths made of repeated characters like `█`, `▓`, `#`, `=`, `*`; axis labels with numeric values; histogram bins; sparkline-style rows)\n   → **Category: Chart** → convert to Markdown table (if simple) or HTML rendering → screenshot PNG image (if complex) (see \"ASCII-to-chart conversion rule\").\n\n3. **Does the ASCII block represent structural relationships?** (boxes connected by arrows or lines; flow direction; entity-relationship grouping; sequence lifelines; tree/hierarchy)\n   → **Category: Diagram** → convert to HTML diagram, render as screenshot PNG, embed as image (see \"ASCII-to-HTML-diagram conversion rule\").\n\nAmbiguity rules:\n- If a block mixes data rows with structural arrows, split it: data rows → MD table, structural part → HTML diagram screenshot.\n- If a pipe-aligned block is clearly a diagram legend or label (no meaningful row data), treat it as part of the diagram.\n- When in doubt, prefer the simpler format (MD table over HTML screenshot) to maximize portability.\n- Add a one-line HTML comment `<!-- Converted from ASCII art: [original description] -->` above each converted block so reviewers can trace origin.\n\n> [AI RULE] Never leave ASCII art unconverted. Every ASCII visual block must be classified and transformed to its target format.\n\n### ASCII-to-HTML-diagram conversion rule\n\nWhen the source Markdown contains ASCII art diagrams (box-drawing characters like `┌─┐│└─┘`, `+---+`, pipe-aligned tables used as diagrams, or any text-art layout representing structure), convert them to high-quality PNG images via HTML rendering and screenshot capture.\n\nConversion pipeline:\n1. **Analyze** the ASCII diagram — identify entities, relationships, groupings, flow direction, and labels.\n2. **Generate** a self-contained HTML file with inline CSS that visually reproduces the diagram as a clean, professional graphic.\n3. **Render** the HTML in a headless browser (Playwright or equivalent browser tool).\n4. **Screenshot** the rendered diagram as a PNG image.\n5. **Save** the PNG to `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/<diagram-name>.png`.\n6. **Embed** the image in the Markdown output: `![<diagram description>](images/<diagram-name>.png)`.\n7. **Delete** the temporary HTML file. Do not keep it in the output.\n\nConversion guidelines:\n- Identify the diagram type and apply the matching HTML/CSS pattern (see \"Diagram type HTML/CSS templates\" below):\n  - DB schemas, ER diagrams → entity-box layout with relationship lines\n  - Architecture, system layout, grouping → nested container layout with labeled connections\n  - Flows, pipelines → node-and-arrow horizontal or vertical layout\n  - Sequences, timelines → lifeline-based column layout\n  - Class/object relationships → box layout with typed connectors\n  - Tree/hierarchy → indented or layered box layout\n- Preserve every entity, relationship, label, and grouping from the original ASCII art. Do not omit items.\n- Use nested `<div>` containers for grouped/boxed sections when the original uses visual grouping.\n- If the ASCII art is ambiguous, add a one-line HTML comment in the generated HTML noting the assumption.\n- Do not keep the original ASCII art alongside the embedded image; replace it entirely.\n\nNaming convention for diagram images:\n- Use a descriptive kebab-case name derived from the diagram's context: `architecture-overview.png`, `auth-flow.png`, `er-schema.png`.\n- If multiple diagrams exist in the same document, suffix with a zero-padded index in document order: `data-flow-01.png`, `data-flow-02.png`.\n- Naming must be deterministic: for the same input, produce the same filenames every run.\n- If a filename collision occurs in the same `<docId>`, append a short stable suffix: `data-flow-01-a3f2.png`.\n\n### Diagram rendering and capture rule\n\nEvery diagram image must be visually verified. A broken or mis-rendered diagram is worse than no diagram.\n\nRendering flow:\n1. Write the self-contained HTML file to `temp/diagram-<name>.html`.\n2. Create `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/` if it does not exist.\n3. Navigate the browser tool to `file://<absolute-path>/temp/diagram-<name>.html`.\n4. Wait at least 400 ms for rendering to stabilize.\n5. Call the browser tool's screenshot function with the output file path explicitly set to the absolute path of `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/<diagram-name>.png`. Do not rely on a default save location.\n6. **Always regenerate on this run**: do not depend on pre-existing PNG files. For each converted diagram, create or overwrite `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/<diagram-name>.png` in the current run.\n7. **Hard gate**: Check that the PNG file exists on disk and has non-zero size. If it is missing or empty, retry from step 3 with 800 ms wait. If it still fails, delete any partial output, fix the HTML/CSS, and retry until capture succeeds. Never finish with a missing PNG for a converted diagram.\n8. **Filesystem proof (required)**: run a direct file existence check on the exact output path (for example `ls -l <absolute-png-path>` or equivalent tool read). Proceed only when the file is present and size > 0.\n9. Visually verify: all labels readable, no overlapping elements, layout matches original. If broken, fix the HTML/CSS and redo from step 3.\n10. Keep `temp/diagram-<name>.html` until the PNG is confirmed on disk and the Markdown image tag has been inserted.\n11. Compute the relative path from the rewritten Markdown file's directory to the saved PNG. Example: if the Markdown is at `docs/FORM_EVENT.rewritten_v1.md` and the PNG is at `docs/MaraudersMap/FORM_EVENT/images/campaign-lifecycle.png`, the relative path is `./MaraudersMap/FORM_EVENT/images/campaign-lifecycle.png`.\n12. In the rewritten Markdown, locate the exact lines of the original ASCII block (start line to end line). Delete those lines entirely — do not touch any surrounding text, headings, or links. Insert the following two lines in their place, and nothing else:\n    ```\n    <!-- Converted from ASCII art: [original description] -->\n    ![<diagram description>](<relative-path-to-png>)\n    ```\n    The result must be exactly one comment line followed by exactly one image tag line. No extra text, no duplicate alt, no wrapping in a link.\n13. Re-check that the referenced PNG path in the inserted image tag exists on disk. Only then delete `temp/diagram-<name>.html`.\n\nFailure handling:\n- If capture fails, keep the temp HTML for retry and delete only broken PNG output. Retry capture from step 3 using the same HTML.\n- If an expected image file is missing (including user-deleted files), treat it as a required regeneration task and recreate it in the current run.\n- Never insert a Markdown image path before filesystem proof passes for the exact PNG file.\n- Never keep partial or invalid outputs.\n- Keep captured PNGs on local disk; Markdown image links depend on them.\n\nRegression guard (required):\n- Reproduce this case before finalizing any diagram conversion: Markdown references `./MaraudersMap/FORM_EVENT_INTRODUCTION/images/campaign-lifecycle.png` but the PNG file is missing on disk.\n- Expected behavior: regenerate `docs/MaraudersMap/FORM_EVENT_INTRODUCTION/images/campaign-lifecycle.png` in the same run, then keep exactly one valid Markdown image tag pointing to the relative path.\n- Forbidden behavior: leaving a dangling image path, deleting the temp HTML before successful capture, producing malformed Markdown such as `![a]![a](...)` or `[text](/![a](...))`.\n\nScreenshot quality:\n- Viewport: 600–1200 px wide. Device pixel ratio: 2.\n- Background: white (`#ffffff`). No browser chrome or scrollbars.\n- All text legible at final embedded size.\n\n> [AI RULE] Never embed a diagram image that has not been visually verified. If the rendering looks wrong, fix and re-render.\n\n### Diagram type HTML/CSS templates\n\nUse these patterns as a starting point when generating HTML for each diagram type. Adapt layout, colors, and sizing to match the specific diagram's content. All templates share these base styles:\n\n**Base styles (shared across all diagram types):**\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n<style>\n  * { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }\n  body {\n    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif;\n    background: #ffffff;\n    padding: 16px;\n    width: fit-content;\n    color: #1e293b;\n  }\n  .diagram { display: inline-block; }\n  .box {\n    border: 1.5px solid #64748b;\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    padding: 10px 16px;\n    background: #f8fafc;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    text-align: center;\n    white-space: nowrap;\n  }\n  .box-title {\n    font-size: 11px;\n    font-weight: 600;\n    color: #64748b;\n    text-transform: uppercase;\n    letter-spacing: 0.5px;\n    margin-bottom: 4px;\n  }\n  .container {\n    border: 2px solid #334155;\n    border-radius: 12px;\n    padding: 20px;\n    background: #ffffff;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  .container-label {\n    font-size: 15px;\n    font-weight: 700;\n    color: #1e293b;\n    margin-bottom: 16px;\n  }\n  .row {\n    display: flex;\n    gap: 16px;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: flex-start;\n  }\n  .col {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    gap: 12px;\n    align-items: center;\n  }\n  .arrow-down {\n    width: 2px;\n    height: 24px;\n    background: #94a3b8;\n    position: relative;\n    margin: 0 auto;\n  }\n  .arrow-down::after {\n    content: '';\n    position: absolute;\n    bottom: -4px;\n    left: 50%;\n    transform: translateX(-50%);\n    border-left: 5px solid transparent;\n    border-right: 5px solid transparent;\n    border-top: 6px solid #94a3b8;\n  }\n  .arrow-right {\n    width: 24px;\n    height: 2px;\n    background: #94a3b8;\n    position: relative;\n    align-self: center;\n  }\n  .arrow-right::after {\n    content: '';\n    position: absolute;\n    right: -4px;\n    top: 50%;\n    transform: translateY(-50%);\n    border-top: 5px solid transparent;\n    border-bottom: 5px solid transparent;\n    border-left: 6px solid #94a3b8;\n  }\n  .badge {\n    display: inline-block;\n    font-size: 11px;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    color: #475569;\n    background: #e2e8f0;\n    border-radius: 4px;\n    padding: 2px 8px;\n    margin-top: 4px;\n  }\n  .separator {\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 1px;\n    background: #e2e8f0;\n    margin: 16px 0;\n  }\n</style>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div class=\"diagram\">\n  <!-- Diagram content here -->\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n**Architecture / system layout diagram:**\n\nUse nested `.container` elements for system boundaries and `.box` for components. Connect with `.arrow-down` or `.arrow-right`. Example structure:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"container\">\n  <div class=\"container-label\">System Name</div>\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"box\">Component A</div>\n    <div class=\"arrow-right\"></div>\n    <div class=\"box\">Component B</div>\n    <div class=\"arrow-right\"></div>\n    <div class=\"box\">Component C</div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"arrow-down\"></div>\n  <div class=\"container\" style=\"border-color: #94a3b8;\">\n    <div class=\"container-label\" style=\"font-size: 13px;\">Data Layer</div>\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"box\">\n        <div class=\"box-title\">table</div>\n        cache\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"box\">\n        <div class=\"box-title\">table</div>\n        queue_jobs\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Flowchart / pipeline diagram:**\n\nUse horizontal (`.row`) or vertical (`.col`) layouts with arrows between steps. For decision nodes, use a rotated diamond shape:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"col\">\n  <div class=\"box\" style=\"background: #dbeafe; border-color: #3b82f6;\">Start</div>\n  <div class=\"arrow-down\"></div>\n  <div class=\"box\">Process A</div>\n  <div class=\"arrow-down\"></div>\n  <div class=\"box\" style=\"transform: rotate(45deg); width: 80px; height: 80px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border-radius: 4px;\">\n    <span style=\"transform: rotate(-45deg); font-size: 12px;\">Condition?</span>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"row\" style=\"margin-top: 16px;\">\n    <div class=\"col\">\n      <div class=\"badge\">Yes</div>\n      <div class=\"arrow-down\"></div>\n      <div class=\"box\">Action X</div>\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"width: 48px;\"></div>\n    <div class=\"col\">\n      <div class=\"badge\">No</div>\n      <div class=\"arrow-down\"></div>\n      <div class=\"box\">Action Y</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**ER / database schema diagram:**\n\nUse table-like boxes with attribute lists. Connect entities with labeled lines using SVG or CSS pseudo-elements:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"row\" style=\"gap: 64px; align-items: flex-start;\">\n  <div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: left; padding: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n    <div style=\"background: #334155; color: #fff; padding: 8px 16px; font-weight: 600; font-size: 14px;\">users</div>\n    <div style=\"padding: 8px 16px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8;\">\n      <strong>id</strong> : uuid (PK)<br>\n      name : varchar<br>\n      email : varchar (UQ)<br>\n      created_at : timestamp\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"align-self: center; font-size: 12px; color: #64748b;\">1 ──── N</div>\n  <div class=\"box\" style=\"text-align: left; padding: 0; overflow: hidden;\">\n    <div style=\"background: #334155; color: #fff; padding: 8px 16px; font-weight: 600; font-size: 14px;\">orders</div>\n    <div style=\"padding: 8px 16px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8;\">\n      <strong>id</strong> : uuid (PK)<br>\n      user_id : uuid (FK)<br>\n      total : decimal<br>\n      status : enum\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Sequence diagram:**\n\nUse column-based layout with vertical lifelines and horizontal message arrows. Lifelines are vertical dashed borders; messages are styled horizontal connectors:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 0; position: relative; min-height: 300px;\">\n  <!-- Participant headers -->\n  <div style=\"flex: 1; text-align: center;\">\n    <div class=\"box\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 8px;\">Client</div>\n    <div style=\"width: 2px; height: 250px; border-left: 2px dashed #cbd5e1; margin: 0 auto;\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"flex: 1; text-align: center;\">\n    <div class=\"box\" style=\"display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 8px;\">Server</div>\n    <div style=\"width: 2px; height: 250px; border-left: 2px dashed #cbd5e1; margin: 0 auto;\"></div>\n  </div>\n  <!-- Messages (absolutely positioned over lifelines) -->\n  <div style=\"position: absolute; top: 60px; left: 15%; right: 15%;\">\n    <div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 24px;\">\n      <span style=\"font-size: 12px; flex: 1; text-align: center;\">POST /login</span>\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"height: 2px; background: #475569; position: relative;\">\n      <div style=\"position: absolute; right: -4px; top: -4px; border-left: 6px solid #475569; border-top: 5px solid transparent; border-bottom: 5px solid transparent;\"></div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Tree / hierarchy diagram:**\n\nUse a recursive nested structure with indented containers:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"col\" style=\"align-items: flex-start;\">\n  <div class=\"box\" style=\"background: #dbeafe; border-color: #3b82f6; font-weight: 600;\">Root Node</div>\n  <div style=\"display: flex; gap: 32px; margin-left: 24px; margin-top: 12px;\">\n    <div class=\"col\" style=\"align-items: flex-start;\">\n      <div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px;\">\n        <div style=\"width: 16px; height: 2px; background: #94a3b8;\"></div>\n        <div class=\"box\">Child A</div>\n      </div>\n      <div style=\"margin-left: 24px; margin-top: 8px;\">\n        <div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px;\">\n          <div style=\"width: 16px; height: 2px; background: #94a3b8;\"></div>\n          <div class=\"box\" style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Leaf A-1</div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col\" style=\"align-items: flex-start;\">\n      <div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 8px;\">\n        <div style=\"width: 16px; height: 2px; background: #94a3b8;\"></div>\n        <div class=\"box\">Child B</div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nAdaptation guidelines:\n- These templates are starting points. Adjust colors, sizes, gaps, and nesting to match the specific diagram's complexity.\n- For very complex diagrams with many connections, consider using inline SVG for precise line routing instead of CSS-only arrows.\n- Use `position: absolute` sparingly — prefer flexbox/grid layout for maintainability.\n- Keep font sizes between 11px–15px for readability in the final screenshot.\n- Test that the diagram fits within the 600–1200px viewport width before capturing.\n\n### ASCII-to-Markdown-table conversion rule\n\nWhen the source Markdown contains data tables drawn with ASCII art (box-drawing characters, `+---+` borders, or space/tab-aligned columns), convert them to standard Markdown pipe tables.\n\nDetection patterns — any of these signals a data table:\n- Rows delimited by `+---+---+` or `├───┼───┤` or `|---|---|` style separators.\n- Cells bounded by `|` or `│` containing data values (not arrows or flow labels).\n- Space-aligned columns with a clear header row followed by a separator row of dashes or `=`.\n- Box-drawing grids (`┌┬┐`, `├┼┤`, `└┴┘`) where cells hold scalar data (names, numbers, settings, status).\n\nConversion guidelines:\n- Detect columns by splitting each row on the delimiter character (`|`, `│`, or consistent whitespace).\n- Trim leading/trailing whitespace in each cell.\n- Identify the header row (first data row, or the row directly above the first separator) and emit it as the Markdown table header.\n- Emit a separator row `|---|---|...` immediately after the header. Use `:---`, `:---:`, or `---:` to preserve original alignment if detectable.\n- Emit each subsequent data row as a pipe-delimited row.\n- If the original table has merged/spanned cells, approximate with repeated values or add a footnote explaining the merge.\n- If the original table has row-group separators (thicker lines, double borders), insert a blank row or a bold label row in the Markdown output to maintain grouping.\n- Preserve every data value exactly. Do not summarize, round, or omit any cell.\n\n> [AI RULE] A converted Markdown table must contain the exact same number of data rows and columns as the ASCII original. Any mismatch is a data-loss bug.\n\n### ASCII-to-chart conversion rule\n\nWhen the source Markdown contains ASCII art representing quantitative data visualization (bar charts, histograms, sparklines, pie-chart text), convert it to the most readable Markdown-native format.\n\nDetection patterns — any of these signals a chart:\n- Rows with repeated fill characters (`█`, `▓`, `▒`, `░`, `#`, `=`, `*`, `■`) whose length encodes a numeric value.\n- An axis label column on the left and a bar on the right (horizontal bar chart).\n- Vertical columns of fill characters with labels at the bottom (vertical bar chart).\n- Percentage labels next to segments (pie-chart text representation).\n- Numeric scale markers along an edge (axis ticks).\n\nConversion decision:\n- **Simple bar chart (≤10 items, single series)** → Markdown table with a `Bar` column using repeated `█` in inline code for visual reference, plus a numeric `Value` column.\n- **Multi-series or complex chart** → HTML rendering → screenshot PNG image (use CSS bar/chart layout with inline styles).\n- **Pie/donut chart** → HTML rendering → screenshot PNG image (use SVG `<circle>` with `stroke-dasharray` for segments).\n- **Sparkline or trend** → Markdown table with rows for each data point; optionally HTML rendering → screenshot PNG image (use SVG `<polyline>` for line charts).\n\nConversion guidelines:\n- Extract every data label and its corresponding value from the ASCII chart.\n- Preserve the original data ordering (e.g., descending by value, chronological).\n- Include units if present in the original (e.g., `%`, `ms`, `MB`).\n- For HTML chart images, add a `title` matching the original chart's caption or heading context.\n- Validate HTML chart images using the same rendering and capture flow as diagrams (see \"Diagram rendering and capture rule\").\n\n> [AI RULE] Every numeric value visible in the ASCII chart must appear in the converted output. Missing data points are conversion failures.\n\n### Repository safety rule\n\n- Never modify `README.md` in this repository. All changes must be confined to skill artifacts and generated MaraudersMapMD outputs only.\n\n### Artifact hygiene and structure rule\n\n- Always delete outdated or superseded MaraudersMapMD artifacts (old shard packs, stale indexes, obsolete JSON packs) so the project folder never accumulates unused files.\n- Enforce a single, stable folder structure: `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/*.png` for visuals, plus cross-doc SQLite index at `docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db`.\n- One stable `<docId>` directory per logical document (base name). New rewritten versions must overwrite artifacts in the same `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/` directory, not create new versioned docId directories.\n- If artifacts derived from the original source file exist, delete them immediately.\n- Do not create or keep alternative artifact directories or extra copies outside the structure above.\n- Delete orphaned images in `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/` that are not referenced by the rewritten Markdown, but only after all converted ASCII blocks have been embedded and verified. Do not run orphan cleanup during capture.\n- Never delete PNG files that are referenced by the active rewritten Markdown.\n- Before finalizing, ensure no `temp/diagram-*.html` files remain.\n- Before starting a new rewrite run, delete stale `temp/diagram-*.html` files left from previous failed runs.\n- Never delete a `temp/diagram-*.html` file that belongs to the current capture attempt until PNG filesystem proof passes and Markdown insertion is complete.\n\n### Final honest review rule\n\n- Always end the workflow with a brief self-audit: re-check completed work against all rules and verify nothing is missing.\n- If any gap is found, fix it before completing the task.\n\n### Phase 1 — Baseline capture (before any rewriting)\n\nRead the original source file directly. If a rewritten version already exists, read that rewritten file as immediate context. Do not rewrite anything yet. Do not generate any artifacts from the original file.\n\n### Phase 2 — Create working copy\n\nDetermine the base name and next version before creating any file:\n\n- **Base name**: Strip any `.rewritten_v{n}` suffix from the source filename. `guide.md` → base `guide`. `guide.rewritten_v1.md` → base `guide`. Never include `.rewritten_v{n}` in the base.\n- **Next version**: If no prior rewritten file exists, use `v1`. If `<base>.rewritten_v{n}.md` already exists, use `v{n+1}`.\n- **Working copy path**: `temp/temp_<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md` where `N` is the next version.\n- **Filename normalization gate (required)**: Before writing output, normalize the target name to `<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md`. Remove any chained segments such as `.rewritten.rewritten`, `.rewritten_v1.rewritten_v2`, or repeated `.rewritten` tokens. These names are invalid and must be corrected before saving.\n\nExamples: `guide.md` (first run) → `temp/temp_guide.rewritten_v1.md`. `guide.rewritten_v1.md` (re-run) → `temp/temp_guide.rewritten_v2.md`. `guide.rewritten.rewritten.md` (invalid source name) still normalizes to base `guide` and must output `temp/temp_guide.rewritten_v{N}.md`.\n\nAll intermediate files go inside `temp/`. All edits happen ONLY on the working copy. Never modify the source.\n\n### Phase 3 — Skeleton\n\nUsing the source and rewritten context, write a flat heading list in the working copy. Next to each heading note its one-line purpose. Fix heading levels so they descend without skips (single `#`, then `##`, then `###`). If the document is long, place a concise summary after the title.\n\n### Phase 4 — Rewrite and SQLite ingest\n\n1. Rewrite the working copy using the canonical prompt rules: shorten paragraphs, convert dense prose to bullets, use tables for settings/options, keep code blocks unchanged.\n2. Convert ASCII visuals and generate PNG files according to the diagram/chart rules.\n3. Move the finalized working copy to `<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md`.\n4. Ingest the document into SQLite: `python shards_db.py --ingest docs/MaraudersMap/<docId> --map-root docs/MaraudersMap`.\n\nParallel rewrite guidance: documents are independent and may be processed in parallel. Within one document, keep rewrite -> image capture -> ingest order sequential.\n\n### Phase 5 — Verification and cleanup\n\nCompare the finished output against the rewritten file and SQLite retrieval results:\n1. SQLite query by keyword returns expected section(s) for the document.\n2. SQLite BM25 query returns relevant results for the document.\n3. Every embedded image path exists on disk and resolves correctly.\n4. On simulated cache miss (query with no hit), fallback to rewritten file works.\n5. Run the checklist below.\n\nAfter verification passes:\n1. Ensure `<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md` is present and normalized.\n2. Ensure SQLite is up to date for this doc (`python shards_db.py --ingest ...` completed without error).\n3. If processing multiple docs, run per-doc ingest in parallel, then run `python shards_db.py --status --map-root docs/MaraudersMap` once.\n4. Delete the `temp/` folder entirely.\n5. Delete stale artifacts: remove original-file-derived outputs and stale version-suffixed docId directories for the same base (for example `guide_v2`).\n6. Confirm the project contains: original source (untouched), exactly one active rewritten file (`<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md`), SQLite DB (`docs/MaraudersMap/shards.db`), and images under `docs/MaraudersMap/<docId>/images/*.png`.\n7. Confirm there are no invalid rewritten filenames in the working set (for example `*.rewritten.rewritten.md` or `*.rewritten_v*.rewritten_v*.md`). If found, rename to the normalized `<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md` form before completion.\n\n### Sync rule — rewritten changes must update SQLite\n\nIf the rewritten document is edited at any time:\n1. Re-run the MaraudersMapMD generation on the current rewritten version file (`<base>.rewritten_v{N}.md`).\n2. Re-ingest the updated doc into SQLite: `python shards_db.py --ingest docs/MaraudersMap/<docId> --map-root docs/MaraudersMap`.\n3. Verify with a SQLite query that expected content is retrievable.\n4. Do not continue work until SQLite results match the rewritten document.\n",
