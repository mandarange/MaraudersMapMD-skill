- [ ] Paragraphs are short (2–4 lines); dense prose converted to bullets
- [ ] Tables used for settings, options, or structured comparisons
- [ ] No hard line breaks inside paragraphs
- [ ] No extra blank lines inside lists
- [ ] Typos fixed; product names, command names, and identifiers preserved exactly
- [ ] AI Hint Blocks (`> [AI RULE]`, `> [AI DECISION]`, `> [AI TODO]`, `> [AI CONTEXT]`) used only where the source content warrants them
- [ ] All facts, constraints, and technical details from the source are present in the output
